ML Model to classify a diseased heart based on visual parameters

Development of a tree-based model that classifies presence of heart disease.
An initial pass is made using decision trees. To further improve the model performance, Random Forest is used for the second pass.

The features used for training the model include

1. Health history: Record of chest pain, thalassemia
2. Demographic data like sex, age
3. Vitals: Resting blood pressure, blood sugar, serum cholestrol, maximum heart rate
Variables are treated using proper standardisation and encoding techniques.

The model is evaluated using accuracy, precision and recall rates and ROC curve is also constructed.

Finally, hyperparameter tuning is deployed to improve model performance.

This is a generalistic approach to classification using Decision trees and Random Forest and can be extended to other feature sets and use cases.
